Step 1: Purpose
---------------

Creating new layouts gives you the ability to make individual pages, or types of pages, better positioned to display content in a way that is optimized for the page type. For example, you may not even want your mainbody content to appear on a specific page, or if you do, you might want it to have more or less space in relation to the sidebar.

A new layout gives you the ability to create a custom experience for you users throughout their visit, from the front page to your contact form.
