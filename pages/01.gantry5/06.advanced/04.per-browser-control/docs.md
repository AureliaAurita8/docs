The Gantry Framework has the ability to load different CSS files based upon which browser and operating system is viewing the template. This allows complete control over how a site is displayed to even the pickiest browser!

Every CSS file can be customized for different browser and operating system combinations with Gantry Framework. This is handy for targeting specific browser issues, such as IE6 compatibility. Each file is automatically loaded by the framework based on which browser/operating system is viewing the template.
