Gantry 5 has support for [Font Awesomeâ€™s](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) growing font library built right in to its core. This means that anyone using a Gantry-powered template will have the ability to use any of these incredible vector fonts anywhere on your page.

These serve as lightweight alternatives to image files, can add a visual element to a menu option or an eye-catching accent to a block of text. You can add them to Particles, as well as to fields in your theme's **Styles** administrative panel to add an easily-configured element to your site.

## Using the Icon Picker

{% set callout_items %}
Search [9%, 2%, se]
  : Use this field to search for a icon by name. The number in the upper-right corner of the field indicates how many matches there are to your current string.

Fixed Width [10%, 46%, se]
  : Selecting this checkbox gives the icon Font Awesome's included `fa-fw` class, setting it as a fixed width. This is useful when different icon widths throw off alignment. It is especially useful in things like navigation lists and list groups.

Spinning [10%, 59%, se]
  : Selecting this checkbox sets the `fa-spin` class on the icon, causing it to take on an animated spinning effect. Great for circle, cog, and spinner icons.

Size [10%, 70%, se]
  : This dropdown sets the size of the icon. The options are: Large, 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x.

Rotation [10%, 81%, se]
  : This dropdown gives you the ability to rotate the icon. For example, you could use it to have an arrow point left, up, or down instead of right.

Select [86%, 75%, se]
  : Use the green **Select** button to lock in your icon of choice (listed in the text directly to the left). To choose a icon, simply select the checkbox in that icon's listing in the icon browser.

{% endset %}

## Adding the Icon Picker to Your Site

The Icon Picker is a Gantry 5 input. If you want to add it to your theme or particle, you would do so by assigning the administrative input as `input.icon` in the associated YAML file. 

Here is an example of how this would look in the YAML file of a section of a theme. In this example, the **feature.yaml** is located in `theme/blueprints/styles/`.

The Font Picker is a Gantry 5 input. If you want to add it to your template or particle, you would do so by assigning the administrative input as `input.fonts` in the Particle's YAML file. 

Here is an example of how this would look in the YAML file.

```yaml
target:
      type: input.icon
      label: Icon
      description: Select the icon you would like to use.
      default: fa fa-rocket
```

This example accomplishes two things. First, it creates the **Feature** section in the Gantry **Styles** administrative panel, as well as the **Background** and **Text** color settings you can easily configure from the Gantry 5 Administrator.

Second, it provides fields the theme can hook to, providing the color variable used when the page is rendered.
