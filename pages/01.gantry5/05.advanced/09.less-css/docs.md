**LESS** is a dynamic stylesheet language that extends CSS with dynamic behaviours such as variables, mixins, operations and functions. LESS allows your code to be cleaner, optimized whilst also reducing the overall time to create and maintain your code base.

Gantry supports LESS, rooting the compiler and core processes into the Framework itself. Furthermore, the administrator and frontend template are constructed with LESS files that are then outputted as CSS files to the browser. Gantry handles all the complex processing, so you can concentrate purely on the styling.
