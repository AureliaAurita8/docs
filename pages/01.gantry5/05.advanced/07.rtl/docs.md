RTL stands for “right-to-left", a key component when delivering a website in an RTL language such as Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, etc. Gantry has built-in RTL support which will automatically “flip” the content layouts and ordering to support RTL. We’ve also provided an override in the advanced section of the template details, so you can turn this default behavior off if you like. However, if the language file supports it, RTL will be enabled by default.
