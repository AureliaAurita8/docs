Welcome to the Gantry 5 beta! We are excited that you have made the choice to take part in this early testing beta release. We welcome you to test, play with, and enjoy the new features and capabilities that Gantry 5 has to offer.

>>>> The Gantry 5 beta is an early preview and is continuously in active development. **Using the beta release for production sites is NOT recommended** as this is an incomplete release, and any and all aspects are subject to change throughout the development process.

## About the Beta

Gantry 5's initial beta focuses on **Joomla**. This was done in order to allow us to work on any issues that arise with a single CMS first before adding additional CMS support. We plan to have a beta rollout for WordPress, and possibly other platforms in the future.

We have added as many features as possible into the beta, and plan to add more as development continues. You might notice several big differences between the beta and what we have covered in the [RocketTheme Blog](http://rockettheme.com/blog). We have temporarily removed several features, including the import/export functionality in the **Layout Manager** as these are still in early stages of development.

Here are some things you can do with the Gantry 5 beta:

* Test and configure a testing website based on the included Hydrogen template.
* Try out the Menu, Layout Manager, Settings, and Style administrative panels.
* Get accustomed to Gantry 5's new user interface.
* Have fun trying new things with Gantry 5.
* Submit feedback and bug reports using [GitHub's Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) system.

Gantry 5 beta will receive regular updates from our development team, including feature updates and additions, throughout the beta process. Please keep in mind that these changes can sometimes dramatically change how these features function and appear on the backend.

## Keep it Updated

We highly recommend pulling the latest build before testing as changes are continually being made. If you run into a bug, or have a recommendation for improvement, we recommend trying the latest development branch version to see if it has already been resolved before submitting an issue.

## Where to Get Help

A chatroom has been set up using [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) where you can go to talk about the project with developers, contributors, and other members of the community. This is the best place to go to get quick tips and discuss features with others.

[Documentation](http://gantry-framework.org) is also available, and being continually added to as development progresses. Is something missing? You can contribute to the documentation through GitHub.
