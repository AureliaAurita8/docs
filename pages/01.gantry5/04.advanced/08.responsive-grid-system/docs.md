The Gantry Framework was originally based on the [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/) that offered a 12-column grid structure based on a fixed 960px-width layout. From version 4.x on, the responsive grid system of [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) is used.

The **Responsive Layout** adapts to the viewing device, such as a smartphone, tablet or desktop, based on the resolution of the screen. There are five different width formats, and each utilizes the grid structure in a different way. This is achieved through **@media queries**, which can detect the width of the browser window, and allows for different CSS, accordingly. This is the basic function that makes responsive designs possible. In effect, a single site will adapt automatically to the viewing device, without the need for separate layouts -- like mobile.

As a note, a responsive layout does not detect a specific device. It only detects the width of the viewing environment. So, any names, such as _smartphone_ or _tablet_, are convenient shorthand only.
