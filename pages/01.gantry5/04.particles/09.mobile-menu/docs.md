The **Mobile Menu** Particle is made for the **Offcanvas Section** in the **Layout Manager**. It has one primary purpose: to display a mobile version of the main menu for visitors displaying your site from a mobile device. Because of this, the Mobile Menu Particle does not appear on desktops and other larger-screened devices. Instead, the standard Menu Particle which is located elsewhere on the Layout is used.

Please note that this Particle **must** be unique in the Layout and positioned in the **Offcanvas** section. You will also need a **Menu** present in the **Layout**.

Because the Mobile Menu acts as a container for the menu, it doesn't have any Particle-specific settings. You can, however, use standard Block-level settings to add custom CSS, Variations, etc.
