![Settings](settings.jpeg)

The **Settings** panel gives you the ability to turn particle types **on** or **off** as you please. Doing this will disable the particle for any assigned pages, even if you have it already set in the **Layout Manager**.

Think of this panel as the breaker panel of Gantry. It serves as a one-stop shop for enabling and disabling particles such as the **Logo**, **Date**, and **Google Analytics**. We have a full breakdown of Gantry's included particles [in the next chapter](../../particles).
